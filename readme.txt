Deliver images from Cloudflare's global network. Save bandwidth costs with free-tier friendly R2 storage and zero egress fees.

== Description ==

**Image CDN** is a bandwidth-saving WordPress plugin that delivers your images through Cloudflare's global edge network. Unlike complex image optimization services, Image CDN focuses on one thing: making your existing WordPress images load faster worldwide while cutting bandwidth costs.

**No transformations. No complexity. Just fast, affordable delivery.**

= How It Works =

1. **WordPress generates images** (as it normally does)
2. **Image CDN rewrites URLs** to point to Cloudflare
3. **First request:** Worker caches image in R2
4. **Future requests:** Served directly from R2 (zero cost!)

= Key Benefits =

* **Free Tier Compatible** - Most sites pay $0/month
* **Ultra Simple** - Zero configuration needed
* **Works with WordPress** - No fighting against WP image handling
* **Works with ANY Plugin** - Use your favorite optimization plugins
* **Global Edge Delivery** - Fast worldwide
* **Zero Egress Fees** - Cloudflare R2 advantage

= What It Does =

* Serves images through Cloudflare CDN
* Caches all WordPress image sizes
* Automatic responsive images (srcset)
* Smart fallback for cache misses
* Works with featured images, content images, galleries

= What It Doesn't Do =

* Image transformations (use WordPress or plugins)
* Dynamic resizing (use WordPress image sizes)
* Quality optimization (use optimization plugins)
* Format conversion (use WebP plugins)

**Why:** WordPress already handles image optimization. Image CDN just makes delivery faster and cheaper.

= Perfect For =

* Blogs wanting faster image delivery
* Sites on slow hosting
* Global audiences
* Free tier Cloudflare users
* Developers who want simple solutions

== Installation ==

= Requirements =

1. **Cloudflare Account** (free tier works!)
2. **R2 Enabled** (in Cloudflare Dashboard)
3. **Domain on Cloudflare** (for worker routes)

= Setup Steps =

**1. Deploy Cloudflare Worker (15 minutes)**

The Cloudflare Worker must be deployed separately to your Cloudflare account.
See the GitHub repository for detailed worker deployment instructions:
https://github.com/img-pro/wp-image-cdn-worker

**2. Configure R2 CDN (5 minutes)**

1. Cloudflare Dashboard → R2 → Create bucket
2. Settings → Custom Domains → Add your CDN domain (e.g., cdn.yourdomain.com)

**3. Configure Plugin (2 minutes)**

WordPress Admin → Settings → Image CDN:
* CDN Domain: cdn.yourdomain.com
* Worker Domain: worker.yourdomain.com
* Enable CDN: ✓
* Save Settings

Done! Your images now load from Cloudflare's global edge network.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How much does this cost? =

Most small/medium WordPress sites pay **$0/month** on Cloudflare's free tier.

Cost breakdown:
* Small (100k views/mo): $0/mo
* Medium (500k views/mo): $0-2/mo
* Large (3M views/mo): $0.68/mo

= Do I need to configure image quality? =

No! Image CDN serves the exact images WordPress generates. Use your favorite WordPress image optimization plugin to optimize images before they're cached.

= Does it support WebP? =

Image CDN serves whatever WordPress generates. If you use a WebP conversion plugin, Image CDN will cache and serve those WebP files.

= Is this compatible with optimization plugins? =

Yes! Image CDN works with ALL WordPress image optimization plugins. It doesn't matter which optimization plugin you use - Image CDN will cache and serve the optimized images.

= What happens when I uninstall the plugin? =

The plugin completely removes all settings and data upon uninstallation:
* Plugin settings (imgpro_cdn_settings)
* Version tracking (imgpro_cdn_version)
* Works with multisite installations

Your WordPress images remain unchanged in the media library. Images cached in Cloudflare R2 are not automatically deleted - you can manage those separately in your Cloudflare dashboard.

= Does it work with page builders? =

Yes! Works with all WordPress page builders including Gutenberg and popular third-party page builders.

= Can I use my own Cloudflare account? =

Yes! That's how it's designed. You deploy the worker to your own Cloudflare account and have full control.

= What if I don't want to use Cloudflare? =

This plugin is specifically designed for Cloudflare R2. If you need a different CDN, consider other plugins.

== Technical Details ==

= Architecture =

**Two-Domain Setup:**
* `cdn.yourdomain.com` → R2 Public Bucket (99% of traffic, zero worker cost)
* `worker.yourdomain.com` → Cloudflare Worker (1% of traffic, cache misses only)

**Request Flow:**
1. Browser requests image from CDN domain
2. If cached: Served directly from R2 (20-40ms)
3. If not cached: Fallback to worker domain
4. Worker fetches from WordPress, stores in R2, redirects to CDN
5. Future requests: Served from R2 (zero worker invocations)

= Performance =

* **Cached requests:** 20-40ms (R2 direct)
* **Cache miss:** 200-400ms (fetch + store + redirect)
* **Cache hit rate:** 99%+ after warmup
* **Worker invocations:** ~1% of total requests

= Storage =

Images are stored in R2 with path-based keys:
```
example.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo.jpg
example.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo-300x200.jpg
```

No hash generation, no transformation parameters - just simple caching.

= Code Statistics =

* **Worker:** 1 file, ~150 lines
* **Plugin:** 4 classes, ~850 lines
* **Dependencies:** Cloudflare R2 only
* **Complexity:** Very low

= Open Source =

* Full source code available
* Fork and modify as needed
* Deploy to your own Cloudflare account
* No vendor lock-in
* GPLv2 or later licensed

= Documentation =

* **Quick Start:** README.md
* **Implementation:** .dev/docs/V2_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
* **Architecture:** .dev/docs/CACHE_ONLY_ARCHITECTURE.md
